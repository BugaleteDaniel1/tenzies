# tenzies


I created a simple Tenzies game using React, 
I want to give thx to: -- Bob Ziroll for the design, he has a really good course
                           on React for beginners on Scrimba;
                       -- @Gthibaud for the react confetti effect in the end, 
                           you can install that using npm i react-confetti;
